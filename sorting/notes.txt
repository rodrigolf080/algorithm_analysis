Sorting
So remember this, only a few items and mostly sorted data… you should use insertion sort.

If you’re worried about worse case scenarios, then merge sort is the way to go.
However, if you want to sort in memory on your machine and you’re worried about space complexity, merge sort is going to be really expensive.

With quick sort, you want to use this when your average case performance matters more than your worst case performance.
